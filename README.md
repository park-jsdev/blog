## Technologies / Requirements
- The application was built on [XAMPP 8.0.12](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) on Windows 10.

# Getting Started

## Installing
- Move the files to your web server: (Everything in the 'blog' folder.) Leave the file and folder structure as is, as the program uses relative navigation for url paths.
- Make sure the web server is running (e.g. xampp)
- Go to the url (e.g. "http://localhost/phpmyadmin"), log in to phpAdmin. Create your own schema, or optionally use the example schema.
- Import your database by importing example_schema.sql file, and also the rss_feed.sql file.
- Navigate in your local machine, to the url which points to the 'blog' folder: (e.g. "http://localhost/blog/").
- Because this application uses HTTPS, you may need to confirm proceeding to the path initially.
- If you see the My Blog home page, then your installation is complete. 

## Usage and Testing
- Once logged in as an admin, select the "Post Manager" link and try the following features:
    - Switch categories from the categories list.
    - Select a post under the selected category.
    - Edit or Delete the post.
    - Choose and upload a new file for the post.
    - Add a new post under "Menu".
  
- Category/Topic Manager Usage + Testing:
  - Once logged in as an admin, update a category name, add one or delete one. You may only delete a category if there are no posts under that category.

- News RSS Feed Aggregator Usage + Testing:
  - Select the "News" link in the navbar to browse the aggregated RSS feed articles. They link to the original sources.

## Deployment
The application is meant for local development. It will require further work to deploy to a production environment.
